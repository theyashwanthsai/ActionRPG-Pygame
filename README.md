# ActionRPG-Pygame
Trying to build my dream action rpg game like Zelda. This time using python instead of godot. 

note: This project is a prototype. A better and different game will be released on my itch.io page soon.


## To-Do:
-> Player death animation

-> Increase the map size

-> Add new characters

-> Fix bugs
